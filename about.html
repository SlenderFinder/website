    <p>
      Welcome to my page! I am making this because I have been wanting to create a webpage for some time now. It’s something I always thought would be cool, but I never sat down and actually started. Until now.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I was thinking about what the theme should be — gaming, memes, music, life stories — then decided: why not all of the above? This site is my digital playground and therapy zone all in one.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      My name is Radio (online at least), and I’m a dude who thrives on creativity, chaos, and cracking jokes with close friends. If you've made it to this page, you're either curious or lost — either way, welcome.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’m a massive fan of Dead by Daylight. If I’m not building this site, I’m probably running from Ghostface or getting tunneled by a sweaty Nurse. And yeah — I *main* killer, because why let others have fun? 😈
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I also really enjoy coding, even when it breaks my soul. HTML and CSS were my intro, and now I’m diving into JavaScript and even bot development. This site is part of that journey.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Some of my favorite games include DBD, Fallout: New Vegas, Halo, and anything with good lore and chaos. I love dark themes, broken characters, and soundtracks that slap hard.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’m about 6’3”, proudly chaotic neutral, and I have a sense of humor that floats between sarcastic and straight-up cursed. If this site had sound, you’d hear a mix of trap beats, game OSTs, and shitposts.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Hobbies? Oh yeah: gaming, coding, writing weird short stories, collecting random internet trivia, and watching horror movies until 3AM while pretending I’ll be productive the next day.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I hate slow Wi-Fi, campers (in both games and real life), dry chicken, and being interrupted mid-rant. I thrive on passion projects and go feral over aesthetics and glitchy CSS transitions.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      This site isn’t just about me — it’s a place I can experiment, share inside jokes, show off builds, dump screenshots, or scream into the digital void when a gen pops at 99% and I get flashbanged into hell.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’m not some web design god or coding prodigy — I just like learning. Every mistake on this page? It means I tried. Every weird glow or layout bug? That’s my signature move.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Eventually I want to add sections for music I like, memes I’ve hoarded, screenshots from my favorite games, maybe even dumb personality quizzes. This is gonna be my chaos archive.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You can probably expect spicy sections (with warnings ofc), some cursed humor, and maybe a few easter eggs hidden around — because I like giving visitors something to find.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      So yeah — this is the start. A small piece of the internet that’s mine. It’s not perfect, it’s not polished, but it’s 100% Radio. And if you vibe with it? Then you’re welcome to stick around.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by, and I hope this page made you smile, laugh, or at least go "what the hell did I just read?" — because that’s kinda the goal. Stay chaotic, my dudes.
